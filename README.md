# winmbf
WinMBF - Marine's Best Friend, a doom source port, revived for 64bit.

# what is it
WinMBF is a doom source port taken from the original MBF source port, with additions from other engines.

# what works
Sound effects don't work, music does.  It's playable, I took the sources from the old trunk here: http://mancubus.net/svn/hosted/winmbf/ and fixed all the errors and modified the code to be 64bit compatible and fixed some SDL_mixer segfaults.

# versioning
I decided to keep the version name 'MBF' and simply bumped it to version 3.0.

# building
MingW was used for building it (64bit only) with custom compiled SDL1.2 libraries.  I will not be making an SDL2 version, that would be an undertaking that I'm not motivated to do.  But feel free to do a pull request if you're up to the task :)

# is it fun
Definitely, doom was always a great game and it's nice to play it on a source port that is pure.

# how to get it
In the Releases tab, there is a release binary which is a 'download and play' zip.  It does NOT include any wads, but if you have the full game, then you just need to copy your wad and play.  If you want the demo, find 'doom1.wad' on the net, it's publicly available under shareware.

Enjoy it :)
